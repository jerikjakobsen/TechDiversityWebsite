# Tech Diversity Website

### This website was created with react, and is hosted by firebase hosting.


I created this website as a way to contribute to a more diverse tech industry. It includes role models for minorities and women in tech, an explanation on the issue, some solutions to the problem, and some of what's being done to help solve the issue.

## To start

1. Clone from github into a directory.

2. In the same directory run "yarn install" to install all the dependencies. (Must have yarn installed)

3. Once this is done, run yarn start.
