        <h2>Whats the Problem?</h2>
        <p>
        Today women make up 50.8 % of the U.S population, African Americans make up 13.4 %, Hispanics/Latinos make up 18.3%, and Asians make up 5.9% of the population. However this isn’t reflected back onto the demographics of workers in the tech industry. The tech field is made up of only 7.4 % African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos make up 8 %, and Women make up 36%.  Asians however almost triple their representation with 14% of people in tech being Asian, whites represent 68.5% of the field, and men represent 64 % of the field(U.S. Census Bureau). The problem is lack of diversity in tech, this leads to race based issues and technology targeted more for whites and men rather than for minorities and women.

        <h2>Why is it an issue?</h2>
        <p>
        This is an issue because there have already been a lot of examples of AI having racial and gender biases because of the lack of representation, sexual harassment of women in the workplace, a steeper hill to higher up positions for women and minorities in tech when compared to white males, minorities and women leaving tech jobs because they don’t feel included in a profession dominated by white men and many more problems that arise from the lack of diversity. According to the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) 32% of women in tech professions feel “stalled” and quit a year into employment. So it’s harder for women to progress into higher up positions, which is only supported by the fact that 80% of high tech executive positions are occupied by men. (EEOC) Some examples of racially biased AI is in 2017 Chukwuemeka Afigbo, a Facebook employee in Africa, tried to use a soap dispenser, but to his dismay the soap dispenser wouldn’t work. He then used a white napkin, which is when the soap dispenser worked. It seems like the people who made the soap dispenser didn’t have people with darker skin in mind when creating the dispenser.(2017 Pavey) Another example of the lack of diversity leading to another racial case is when google’s face recognition software reported that a picture of a black girl and her friend as gorillas in 2015(2018 Vincent).
