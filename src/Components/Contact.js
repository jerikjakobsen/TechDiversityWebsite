        <h2>Benefits of Being in Tech</h2>
        <p>
          There are many, MANY benefits of working in tech, but these are just a few...
          <ul>
            <li>The work culture and environment is known to be very laid back and not very strict.
                As long as you get your work done a lot of top tier tech companies allow you to come in when
                you please. Most also offer free food!
            </li>
            <li>
              If you're a good candidate you could be making a LOT of money. Just starting off you could be making anywhere 
              from $80,000 to $500,000 a year in total compensation. This derives from performance bonuses, sign on bonuses,
              equity, salary and other factors. 
            </li>
            <li>
              You could work from home by freelancing, or start your own company and work from anywhere in the world!
            </li>
            <li>Tech companies are always hiring, so you'll always have somewhere to go. You most likely won't become unemployed
              unless there is some major market shift, but that likely isn't happening anytime soon, or ever.
            </li>
            <li>The job is satisfying. You could be fixing a problem that you or your neighbor has had for years, but hasn't had 
              any of the experience needed to do so. Or you could help a company that aligns with your goals, like a charity. Or 
              maybe something you might be interested in like real estate. The tech field is so diverse in terms of what kinds of jobs it 
              offers, you could be working at a company you're actually interested in.
            </li>

          </ul>
