        <p>
          Many Companies like Google and Amazon have started to release diversity
          reports in an effort to be more transparent about their workforce demographics.
          There has also been an increased amount of scholarships and programs to get 
          minorities and women more involved in tech. Google has been holding computer related
          courses in historically minority and women based schools. Although they are putting
          an effort in, it hasn't been enough. According to nsf.gov the growth of women joining 
          Computer/Mathematical Fields is stagnating.

          There are many ways to increase women and minority tech workers. You could provide more 
          funding to schools that are historically minority and women schools for tech courses, events, etc. 
          You could also change the way you recruit by going to schools and representing a more diverse field of 
          employees in recruiters. You could introduce your friends to coding and tech related subjects. There are many 
          ways to help mitigate the lack of diversity in tech, but these are just a few.
